Skybrud.Social
==============

Skybrud.Social is a framework in .NET for integration with various social services like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The framework will handle all the technical parts and API communication so you don't have to.

### Installation

1. [**NuGet Package**][NuGetPackage]  
Install this NuGet package in your Visual Studio project. Makes updating easy.

2. [**ZIP file**][GitHubRelease]  
Grab a ZIP file of the latest release; unzip and move `Skybrud.Social.dll` to the root directory of your website.

2. [**Builds**][DropboxFolder]  
I may occasional upload a build to Dropbox. These are builds in between releases, and are not tested at the same level as releases. As above, move `Skybrud.Social.dll` to the root directory of your website.

### Documentation

Improving the code has higher priority than documentation, so I'm currently a bit behind on the documentation. For the small amount of documentation already written, have a look at the [Skybrud.Social website][Website].
