Skybrud.Social
==============

Skybrud.Social is a framework in .NET for integration with various social services like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The framework will handle all the technical parts and API communication so you don't have to.

### Installation

### Changelog

The [releases page](https://github.com/abjerner/Skybrud.Social/releases) lists all releases since v0.1.1, and each there will be some information for each release on the most significant changes.

### Documentation

Improving the code has higher priority than documentation, so I'm currently a bit behind on the documentation. For the small amount of documentation already written, have a look at the [Skybrud.Social website][Website].

### Experimantal

Supporting and maintaining the implementation for each service takes up a lot of time. I have played around with a few other services than whats officially supported in Skybrud.Social, but haven't had the time to finish these. They should therefore be treated as experimental and under development:

* [**LinkedIn**](https://github.com/abjerner/Skybrud.Social/tree/master/src/Skybrud.Social.LinkedIn)<br />Adds support for both OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2 authenticcation as well as limited access to the LinkedIn API.

* [**Microsoft**](https://github.com/abjerner/Skybrud.Social/tree/master/src/Skybrud.Social.Microsoft)<br />Lets users authenticate using their Microsoft / Windows Live account (user), as well as getting information about that user.
